# LexicalAnalyser-Project
Lexical Analyzer is a program which converts the stream of individual characters, normally arranged as lines into the stream of lexical tokens. Tokenization for instance of and punctuation symbols that make up source code. The main purpose/goal of the project is to take in a C file and produce the sequence of tokens that can be used for the next stage in compilation. This should also take care of necessary error handling conditions that may occur during tokenization.
